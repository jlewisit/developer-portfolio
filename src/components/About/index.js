            I'm a full stack developer with strengths in communication, team
            work, and beating deadlines. I recently earned a certificate in Full
            Stack Web Development from the University of Texas at Austin, where
            I developed skills in JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and more.

            An innovative problem-solver passionate about developing apps, my
            current focus is on mobile-first design and development. Since
            completing my full stack development program, I have continued my
            studies independently to learn more about Android and WordPress
            development. When I'm not designing or developing, I enjoy hiking,
            cycling, or reading up on the latest trends in web and mobile
            development. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a
            fast-paced, quality-driven team. Reach out to me to
